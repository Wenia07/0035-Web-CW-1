        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        In the early 2000s, as single-use plastic water bottles became increasingly popular, their environmental impact and potential health risks were not yet widely recognized. Concerned about this issue, Robert Seals, an inventor from Chico, California, decided to take action. Using materials from his local hardware store, he developed a prototype for the first American-made reusable stainless steel water bottle. Unlike its European counterparts, Seals’ design was free from aluminum and BPA linings, making it both safer and more environmentally sustainable. In 2004, he founded "Klean Kanteen" and introduced these bottles to the U.S. market—initially selling them at music festivals to spread his message of sustainability.

        <h2>Their Goals</h2>
        <p>
        At Klean Kanteen, “sustainability” is more than just a buzzword — it’s a guiding principle that shapes everything we do. To us, it goes beyond adopting measures like carbon offsets, recycled packaging, or renewable energy. Sustainability means creating a business that truly gives more than it takes — one that contributes positively to the planet, people, and communities we serve.
        <p>
        A truly sustainable business understands that every part of its operations is connected to the world around it. It intentionally adopts practices that create value beyond profit — for people, the planet, and future generations. To thrive long-term, a company must consider the full impact of its actions on society, the environment, culture, and technology. This holistic awareness forms the foundation of sustainability and is woven deeply into the identity and purpose of our company.
