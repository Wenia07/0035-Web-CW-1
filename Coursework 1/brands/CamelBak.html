        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        During the Hotter'N Hell 100 — a 100-mile road race held over four scorching days in Wichita Falls, Texas — cyclist Michael Eidson faced a serious challenge: staying hydrated in the extreme heat with few chances to refill his water. As an emergency medical technician, he improvised a clever solution by filling an IV bag with water, placing it inside a white tube sock, and tucking it into the back of his cycling jersey. He slung the hose over his shoulder and secured it with a clothespin, allowing him to drink hands-free while riding. This simple yet innovative idea led to the creation of CamelBak — the pioneer of hands-free hydration.
