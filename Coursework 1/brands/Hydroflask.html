        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        Hydro Flask has grown into a globally recognized brand and a household name, but its journey began with humble origins

        <p>
        As a founding member of the Outdoor Industry Association’s (OIA) Climate Action Corps, we collaborate with organizations across the outdoor sector to take meaningful action against climate change — measuring our impact, developing strategic plans, reducing emissions, and transparently sharing our progress.

        In collaboration with our parent company, Helen of Troy, Hydro Flask is dedicated to tracking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our operations, implementing initiatives and policies to manage and reduce them, and transparently reporting our progress each year.
