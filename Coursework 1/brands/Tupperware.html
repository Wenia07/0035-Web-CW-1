        <h1>Tupperware Brands Corporation</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        The first Tupperware® product started with a simple but revolutionary concept. In the 1940s, chemist Earl Tupper developed an airtight seal for plastic containers—modeled after paint can lids—to help families preserve food and minimize waste during the post-Depression, wartime period. This innovation gave rise to the Wonderlier® Bowl, a pioneering product in food storage, and transformed the way people around the world store, serve, and prepare their food.
        </p>

        <p>
        Since then, Tupperware products have continued to lead in innovation—whether developing microwave-friendly solutions for busy households, helping grow vegetables in space in collaboration with NASA, or promoting sustainability through cutting-edge materials. Today, Tupperware is trusted by millions worldwide and has earned a place in popular culture, appearing in shows and movies such as "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Minions: The Rise of Gru, Lessons in Chemistry, and "Julia".
